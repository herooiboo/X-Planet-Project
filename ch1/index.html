          <h4 class="pointinchapter">1.1.	Travel to another planet</h4>

          <p class="textbookp" >
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main concern is to exploring life more every day. Therefore, people expended their vision and aspirations, and they turned to explore the solar system. It was difficult to send humans to space without knowing about the environment and cosmic nature, so scientists decided to send satellites and robots to explore space. Scientists have succeeded in sending robots and satellites to explore our solar system. Now we were able to learn the nature of space and our solar system through these expeditions. From here, we began to implement the idea of sending Humans into space is better explored and know the possibility of life on another planet. By exploiting natural resources, such as benefitting from hydrogen and oxygen elements present in the water molecule to make fuel that allows them to overcome the gravitational pull. All experts were working hard to exploit all available resources to provide astronauts with a suitable environment that would allow them to live in space for a long period inside. Chemistry experts were able to work on a water freeze project so that astronauts could live in this place without gravity. Know we want to know if we can live on another planet or we can't, so we need to learn about the environment's 
            other planet and learn more about conditions in our solar system.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">1.2.	 Conditions out of our Earth</h4>

          <p class="textbookp">
            Humans have realized the importance of the environment and the importance of preserving it is 1970. The United States of America was the first to understand this matter. As famed anchorman Walter Cronkite put it in a special CBS News broadcast, Earth Day participants had a “common cause of saving a life from the deadly by-products of that bounty: the fouled skies, the filthy waters, the littered earth.”
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Unfortunately, the realization of this matter was late. Earth's atmosphere has already been due to the frequent use of harmful chemicals resulting from factory smoke and car exhaust. This damage to the atmosphere caused a major change in the plant's climate.
            Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, nations have agreed to limit total warming to no more than 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels—with a preferred goal of staying below 1.5 degrees C. To date, emissions-curbing efforts have been unable to put the brakes on quickly enough to meet those targets.
          </p>
         
          <p class="textbookp">
            We also know that all environmental factors are related to each other. Global warming has created new environmental problems. One of the most important and most dangerous of these problems is air pollution.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Air pollution has caused problems that have caused the death of more than one person
            deadly pollution clogging U.S. skies. One of the worst air pollution disasters in the nation’s history came in the fall of 1948 when weather conditions caused a stew of smog to build up in the industrial town of Donora, Pa., sickening thousands and killing 20 people.
                      </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Whereas with time the matter is getting worse and the countries spend a lot of money to get rid of these damages, but unfortunately the situation has not improved.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            And for all this, we must search for another planet on which humans can continue to live.
            Scientists have turned to search for the possibility of a livable place within our solar system and they started with the first planet "Mercury”, But Mercury is known for his very heat and his continuous evaporator, which has been continuously evacuated by the very close proximity of the sun. Scientists decided to go to another planet to explore So they went to Venus. Although there is a great similarity between the Earth's mantle and the cover of Venus, the harsh nature of the environment on Venus' surface prevents the existence of life on it. Where the temperature at the surface of Venus on average reaches 462 degrees Celsius, and its air pressure is large, so the air pressure on the surface of Mars is equivalent to 90 times the air pressure on earth. Scientists believe that there are some active volcanoes on its surface. With a long search in our solar system, scientists were able to arrive at the possibility of life on Mars. Mars is a perfect planet, because the length of the day is almost equivalent to the day-long on our planet, adding to a gel and its most important, it is an optimistic option, because Mercury and Venus have high heat, and our mole does not have a well-standing basis of any residential shimmer shocks of devastating.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">1.3.	 Newton's principles of mechanics</h4>       
          <p class="textbookp">
            It is assumed that the reader has been introduced to Newtonian mechanics applied to one- or two-point objects. This chapter reviews Newtonian mechanics for a motion of many-body systems as well as for macroscopic sized bodies. Newton’s Law of Gravitation also is reviewed. The purpose of this review is to ensure that the reader has a solid foundation of elementary Newtonian mechanics upon which to build the powerful analytic LaGrange and Hamiltonian approaches to classical dynamics.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Newtonian mechanics is based on the application of Newton’s Laws of motion which assume that the concepts of distance, time, and mass, are absolute, that is, motion is in an inertial frame. The Newtonian idea of the complete separation of space and time, and the concept of the absoluteness of time, are violated by the Theory of Relativity as discussed in chapter 16. However, for most practical applications, relativistic effects are negligible and Newtonian mechanics is an adequate description at low velocities. Therefore chapters 3 − 15 will assume velocities for which Newton’s laws of motion are applicable. Therefore, Newton's principles in mechanics were among the most important factors that helped astronauts to know about overcoming Earth's gravity. It also helped them study the movement of the earth and the other planet in our solar system.
            Now we finally could travel from the earth! Let’s looking for another planet that we will live on it.
