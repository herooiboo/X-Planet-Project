          <h3>Mars</h3>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.1.	About mars</h4>

          <p class="textbookp" >
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars has captivated the popular imagination like no other planet. But rather than being the abode of warlike aliens, Mars proves to be an enigmatic world. The red planet is characterized by being close to us, once full of water, warmer and had a thicker atmosphere, offering a potentially habitable environment all of these reasons make it an interesting place to live and study! 
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.2.	As a star</h4>

          <p class="textbookp">
            Once in about every fifteen years, a startling visitant makes his appearance upon our midnight skies, —a great red star that rises at sunset through the haze about the eastern horizon, and then, mounting higher with the deepening night, blazes forth against the dark background of space with a splendor that outshines Sirius and rivals the giant Jupiter himself. Startling for its size, the stranger looks the more fateful for being a fiery red. Small wonder that by many folks it is taken for a portent. Certainly, no one who had not followed in their courses what the Greeks so picturesquely called “the wanderers” (hoi planetai) would recognize in the apparition an orderly member of our own solar family. Nevertheless, one of the wanderers it is, for that star is the planet Mars, large because for the moment near, having in due course again been overtaken by the Earth, in her swifter circling about the Sun, at that point in space where his orbit and hers make their closest approach.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Mars lets us see him as he is, no cloud-veil of his, as a rule, hiding him from view. He thus offers us opportunities for study at a closer range than does any other body in the universe except the Moon. And the Moon balks inquiry at the outset. For that body, from which we might hope to learn much, appears upon inspection to be, cosmically speaking, dead. Upon her silent surface next to nothing now takes place save for the possible crumbling in of a crater wall. For all practical purposes, Mars is our nearest neighbor in space. Of all the orbs about us, therefore, he holds out the most promise of response to that question which man instinctively makes as he gazes up at the stars: What goes on upon all those distant globes? Are they worlds, or are they mere masses of matter? Are physical forces alone at work there, or has evolution begotten something more complex, something not unakin to what we know on Earth as life? It is in this that lies the peculiar interest of Mars.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.3.	Size and shape</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
           With the telescope, we enter upon a new phase in our knowledge of the planet: the determination of its shape and size. The relative plan of the solar system can be learned with great accuracy from observations of the motions of its members; not so easily learned is the scale upon which it is constructed. Although the former is intrinsically a very complicated, the latter a very simple problem, two characteristics of the actual system make it possible to solve the former much more nearly than the latter. One of these characteristics is the fact that the distances between the masses which compose the system are very much greater than dimensions of the masses themselves, of quite a higher order of magnitude. The diameters of the planets are measured by thousands of miles, the distances between them by tens of millions. The second characteristic consists in the approximately spherical shape of the planets themselves, and in the fact that by a mathematical consequence of the actual law of gravitation a sphere acts upon any outside body as if all its mass were concentrated at its center, a most interesting peculiarity not true under many other supposable laws. These two facts very materially simplify the problem of the motions of celestial mechanics. But just as the first of these peculiarities helps us to a comprehension of the relative dimensions of the solar system, so does it hinder us in determining its actual dimensions. This determination depends upon a problem in celestial surveying, finding the distance to a body by measuring the angle it subtends from the two ends of a base-line. Now, as unfortunately, we cannot get off the earth for the purpose, our base-line is at most the diameter of the earth itself, and as the distance to the other body immensely exceeds our size, the angle to be measured becomes so excessively small as to be very difficult to determine with accuracy. Fortunately, this is matter chiefly of theoretic regret, as we now know the actual sizes to within a degree of exactness practically sufficient for most purposes but perturbations; to within about 1/300 part of the whole, so far as our ultimate measure is concerned, the distance we are off from the Sun. A good idea of the method and some appreciation of the difficulty involved in it can be got by considering a precisely similar case, that of determining the distance of a spirea mile and three fifths away by shutting first one eye and then the other and noting the shift of the spire against its background. It is needless to add that without telescopic aid the determination is impossible and that it is exceeding difficult with it. Nevertheless, from the distance of the Sun determined in this manner, we find from measurements of the apparent disk of the planet made at Flagstaff that Mars is about 4,215 miles in diameter. This makes his surface a little more than a quarter that of the Earth and his volume about one-seventh of hers.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
           The next point to find out is his mass, that is, the amount of matter he contains. This is very easy to determine when a planet has a satellite, and very difficult to determine when a planet has not. The reason is this: the mass of a body is known from the pull it exerts, since this pull depends, by the law of gravitation, upon its mass and the square of its distance. If then we know the pull and the distance from which it is exerted, we can find the mass. Now we gauge the pull from its effects in causing some other body to move. By measuring, therefore, the motion of this other body, we learn the mass of the first one. To get this accurately the motion must be large enough to admit of satisfactory measurement in the first place and be as uncomplicated with motions due to pulls of other bodies as possible, in the second. As each body pulls every other, and it is only their relative displacement we can measure, as we have no foothold in space, even the case of only two bodies presents difficulties of apportionment. We can learn the aggregate mass of the two, but not the separate mass of either alone unless it so happens that the mass of one is so insignificant compared with the other that the mass of that other may be taken as the mass of both. Now, this is substantially realized in the case of the solar system. Owing to the greatly disproportionate size of primary and secondary bodies in it, the great size of the Sun as compared with that of any of the planets, and the great size of the planets as compared with their satellites (except the Moon, and she, fortunately, is an only child), the determination of the mass of the smaller by measurement of its motion about the larger,—as if only the pair of bodies under consideration existed, and the mass of both were concentrated in the greater of the two,— is very nearly exact. Inconsequence each planet discloses with some accuracy the mass of the Sun, but tells next to nothing about its mass; and in the same way, each satellite reveals the mass of its primary. The Mass of a planet possessing a satellite is, therefore, easy to determine. Not so that of one which travels unattended. 
The only way to obtain its mass is from the perturbations or disturbing pulls it exerts upon the other planets, or upon stray comets from time to time, and these disturbances are, by the nature of the case, of a much smaller order of magnitude, to say nothing of the fact that all act coincidently to the increased difficulty of disentanglement. The practical outcome of this in the case of Mars was that before his satellites were discovered the values obtained for his mass ranged from 1/3,700,000 to 1/2,500,000, of the mass of the Sun, or, in other words, varied fifty percent. His insignificant satellites, however, and just because they are insignificant, have made it possible to learn his mass with great exactness. It turns out to be 1/3,093,500 of that of the Sun or 10/94 of that of the Earth.

          <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.4.	Climate and atmosphere</h4>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	The Martian Atmosphere:</h4>

          <p class="textbookp">
Not a Drop to Drink, the atmosphere of Mars is very cold and thin compared to the atmosphere of either Earth or Venus: The surface pressure is a mere 0.006 atmosphere. Yet its chemical composition is very close to that of Venus: The Martian atmosphere is 95.3% carbon dioxide (versus 96.5% for Venus) and 2.7% nitrogen (versus 3.5% for Venus). The predominance of carbon dioxide means that Mars, like Earth and Venus, is warmed by the greenhouse effect. However, the Martian atmosphere is so thin that the greenhouse effect is very weak and warms the Martian surface by only 5°C (versus 33°C on Earth). While the perpetual cloud cover on Venus maintains a steady surface temperature, the thin atmosphere on Mars provides very little thermal insulation. While daytime highs on Mars can be as high as 20°C (68°F), at night the temperature can plummet to 140°C (220°F). Water vapor makes up about 0.03% of the Martian atmosphere (versus about 1% for the Earth), and this vapor can form clouds. Figure 11-24b shows clouds that form near the tops of Martian volcanoes when air moves up the volcanic slopes. The rising air cools until the water vapor condenses into ice crystals.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The same process occurs on Earth, but the clouds that form in this way are made of droplets of liquid water rather than ice crystals. Why is there a difference? The explanation is that liquid water cannot exist anywhere on the Martian surface or in the Martian atmosphere. Water is liquid over only a limited temperature range: If the temperature is too low, water becomes ice, and if the temperature is too high, it becomes water vapor. What determines this temperature range is the atmospheric pressure above a body of water or around a water drop. If the pressure is very low, molecules easily escape from the liquid’s surface, causing the water to vaporize. Thus, at low pressures, water more easily becomes water vapor. The average surface temperature on Mars is only about 250 K (23°C, or 10°F), and the average pressure is only 0.006 atmosphere. With this combination of temperature and pressure, water can exist as a solid (ice) and as a gas (water vapor) but not as a liquid. (You can see this same situation inside a freezer, where water vapor swirls around over ice cubes.) Hence, it never rains on Mars and there are no bodies of standing water anywhere on the planet. To keep water on Mars in the liquid state, it would be necessary to increase both the temperature (to keep water from freezing) and the pressure (to keep the liquid water from evaporating). Later in this chapter, we will see evidence that higher temperatures and pressures did exist on Mars billions of years ago, and that there was once liquid water on the surface.
           </p>
           <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	The Martian Poles: Freezing the Atmosphere:</h4>
           <p class="textbookp">
            At very high altitudes above the Martian surface, atmospheric carbon dioxide can freeze into crystals and form clouds. (Frozen carbon dioxide can be made on Earth and is called “dry ice.”) Such frozen carbon dioxide is also found in larger quantities in ice caps at the north and south poles of Mars. Although no spacecraft has successfully landed on the ice caps, their composition can be measured from orbit by comparing the spectrum sunlight reflected from the ice caps with the known reflection spectrum of frozen carbon dioxide. 
           </p>
           <p class="textbookp">
The size of the ice caps varies substantially with the seasons. When it is winter at one of the Martian poles, temperatures there are so low that atmospheric carbon dioxide freezes, and the ice cap grows. (Think of it: It gets so cold at the Martian poles that the atmosphere freezes!) With the coming of spring, much of the carbon dioxide returns to the gaseous state, and the ice cap shrinks. With the arrival of summer, however, the rate of shrinkage slows abruptly and a residual ice cap remains solid throughout the summer. Scientists had long suspected that the north and south residual polar caps contain a large quantity of frozen water that is less easily evaporated. The European Mars Express spacecraft confirmed this idea in 2004. It used its infrared cameras to peer through the carbon dioxide layer at the south polar ice cap and detect the characteristic spectrum of water ice. Because we do not know the thickness of the layer of water ice, the amount of frozen water stored in the Martian polar caps is still unknown. The wintertime freezing of atmospheric carbon dioxide was measured by the Viking Lander 1 and Viking Lander 2 spacecraft, which made the first successful landings on Mars in 1976. Both of these spacecrafts touched down in the northern hemisphere of Mars when it was spring in that hemisphere and autumn in the southern hemisphere. Initially, both spacecraft measured pressures around 0.008 atmospheres. After only a few weeks on the Martian surface, however, atmospheric pressure at both landing sites was dropping steadily. Mars seemed to be rapidly losing its atmosphere, and some scientists joked that soon all the air would be gone! The actual explanation was that winter was coming to the southern hemisphere, causing carbon dioxide to freeze in that hemisphere’s atmosphere and fall as dry-ice “snow.” The formation of this “snow” removed gas from the Martian atmosphere, thereby lowering the atmospheric pressure across the planet. Several months later, when spring came to the southern hemisphere, the dry-ice snow evaporated rapidly and the atmospheric pressure returned to its prewinter levels. The pressure dropped again in the southern hemisphere’s summer because it then winters in the northern hemisphere and dry-ice snow condenses at northern latitudes. Therefore, both temperature and atmospheric pressure change significantly with the Martian seasons.

           <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	The Evolution of the Martian Atmosphere:</h4>
           <p class="textbookp">
A Runaway Icehouse Effect Mars probably had a thicker atmosphere 4 billion years ago. Thanks to Mars’s greater distance from the Sun and hence less intense sunlight, temperatures would have been lower than on the young Earth, and any water in the atmosphere would more easily have fallen as rain or snow. This would have washed much of the planet’s carbon dioxide from its atmosphere, perhaps creating carbonate minerals in which the CO2 is today chemically bound. Measurements from Mars orbit show only small amounts of carbonate materials on the surface, suggesting that the amount of atmospheric CO2 that rained out was small. Hence, even the original Martian atmosphere was relatively thin, though thicker than the present-day atmosphere. Because Mars is so small, it cooled early in its history and volcanic activity came to an end. Thus, any solid carbonates were not recycled through volcanoes as they are on Earth. The depletion of carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere into the surface would therefore have been permanent. As the amount of atmospheric CO2 declined, the greenhouse effect on Mars would have weakened and temperatures have begun to fall. This temperature decrease would have caused more water vapor to condense into rain or snow and fall to the surface, taking even more CO2 with them and further weakening the greenhouse effect. Thus, a decrease in temperature would have caused a further decrease in temperature—a phenomenon sometimes called a runaway icehouse effect. (This is the reverse of the runaway greenhouse effect that has taken place on Venus.) Ultimately, both water vapor and most of the carbon dioxide would have been removed from the Martian atmosphere. With only a very thin CO2 atmosphere remaining, surface temperatures on Mars eventually stabilized at their present frigid values. As both water vapor and carbon dioxide became depleted, ultraviolet light from the Sun could penetrate the thinning Martian atmosphere to strip it of nitrogen. Nitrogen molecules (N2) normally do not have enough thermal energy to escape from Mars, but they can acquire that energy from ultraviolet photons, which break the molecules in two. Ultraviolet photons can also split carbon dioxide and water molecules, giving their atoms enough energy to escape. Indeed, in 1971 the Soviet Mars 2 spacecraft found a stream of oxygen and hydrogen atoms (from the breakup of water molecules) escaping into space. Oxygen atoms that did not escape into space could have combined with iron-bearing minerals in the surface, forming rust like compounds. Such compounds have a characteristic reddish-brown color and may be responsible for the overall color of the planet. Was the early Martian atmosphere thick enough and warm enough for water to remain as a liquid on the planet’s surface? As we will see in the next section, scientists have found evidence on Mars that the answer is a qualified yes.
           </p>
           <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.5.	 Water</h4>
           <p class="textbookp">
Just as ancient fossils on Earth provide evidence of how life has evolved on our planet, ancient rocks and geological formations help us understand how our planet’s surface and atmosphere have evolved. (For example, the oldest rocks on Earth have a chemical structure which shows that they formed in a time when there was little oxygen in the atmosphere and hence before the appearance of photosynthetic planet life.) Planetary scientists who want to learn about the history of Venus and Mars are therefore very interested in looking at ancient rocks on those worlds. On Venus, we cannot look very far into the past, since the planet’s volcanic activity and flake tectonics has erased features more than about 500 million years old. On Mars, by contrast, we expect to find rocks that are billions of years old: The thin atmosphere causes very little erosion, there has been little recent volcanic activity to cover ancient rocks, and there is no subduction to drag old surface features back into the planet’s interior. (The heavy cratering of the southern highlands bears testament to the great age of much of the Martian surface.) In a quest to find these ancient rocks and learn about the early history of Mars, scientists have sent spacecraft to land on the red planet and explore it at close range. Landing on Mars As of this writing (2006) five spacecraft have successfully landed on the Martian surface. Viking Lander 1 and Viking Lander 2, touched down in 1976. They could not move around on the surface, and so each Viking Lander could only study objects within reach of the scoop at the end of its mechanical arm. Three more recent unmanned explorers, Mars Pathfinder (landed 1997) and two Mars Exploration Rovers (landed 2004), were equipped with electrically driven wheels that allow travel over the surface. Unlike the Viking Landers, these rovers did not have a heavy and expensive rocket engine to lower it gently to the Martian surface. Instead, the spacecraft was surrounded by airbags like those used in automobiles. Had there been anyone to watch Mars Pathfinder or one of the Mars Exploration Rovers land, they would have seen an oversized beach ball hit the surface at 50 km/h (30 mi/h), then bounce for a kilometer before finally rolling to a stop. Unharmed by its wild ride, the spacecraft then deflated its airbags and began to study the geology of Mars. Figure 11-20 shows the landing sites of the Mars Pathfinder rover (named Sojourner) and the two Mars Exploration Rovers (named Spirit and Opportunity). Following directions from Earth, Sojourner spent three months exploring the rocks around its landing site. The Mars Exploration Rovers were also designed for a three-month lifetime, but both were still functioning more than 21⁄ 2 years after landing. Over that time Spirit and Opportunity had each traveled several kilometers over the Martian surface.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	Searching for Martian Water:</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
The two Mars Exploration Rovers also landed in sites that were suspected to have been underwater in the distant past. Spirit touched down in Gusev Crater, a large impact basin. A valley opens into this crater, resembling a river that runs into a lake. The destination for Opportunity was the flat plain of Sinus Meridianii, where orbiting spectrometers had spotted evidence of hematite—a type of iron oxide that, on Earth, tends to form in wet locations. Contrary to expectations, most of the rocks encountered by Spirit show no evidence that they have been exposed to water. The volcanic rocks found in and around Gusev Crater are composed of the minerals olivine and pyroxene, which break down if they are exposed to liquid water. In a few locations, Spirit found deposits of sulfur salts, which can be formed by the action of water.However, olivine and pyroxene were still found among the sulfur salts. While it remains a possibility that Gusev Crater was once a river-fed lake, the results from Spirit show that for the past billion years this region has been drier than any desert on Earth. The results from Opportunity were entirely different. This rover discovered outcrops of sedimentary rocks on the plains of Sinus Meridianii. These rocks are heavily laden with sulfur compounds, strongly suggesting that they were produced by the evaporation of sulfur-rich water. The opportunity also found millimeter-sized spheres of hematite that, like analogous spheres found on Earth, probably formed from iron-rich water circulating through sediment. These observations suggest Sinus Meridianii, which is among the flattest places known in the solar system, was once a lake bed. It is not known how long ago this area was underwater, but the density of craters found there suggests that the surface formed 3 to 4 billion years ago. When combined with observations from Mars orbit, the Spirit and Opportunity results show that ancient Mars was a very diverse planet. Most of the planet was probably very dry, like Gusev Crater, but there were isolated areas like Sinus Meridianii that had liquid water for some time. It remains a challenge to planetary scientists to explain why liquid water appeared on Mars only in certain places and at certain times. 
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	Where Is the Water Now?</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Whatever liquid water once coursed over parts of the Martian surface is presumably now frozen, either at the polar ice caps or beneath the planet’s surface. To check this idea, scientists used a device onboard the Mars Odyssey orbiter to measure the result of cosmic rays hitting Mars. Cosmic rays are fast-moving subatomic particles that enter our solar system from interstellar space. When these particles strike and penetrate the Martian soil, they collide with the nuclei of atoms in the soil and knock out neutrons. If the ejected neutrons originate within a meter or so of the surface, they can penetrate through the regolith and escape into space. However, if there are water molecules (H2O) in the surface, the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms in these molecules will absorb the neutrons and prevent them from escaping. An instrument onboard Mars Odyssey detects neutrons coming from Mars; where the instrument finds a deficiency of neutrons is where the soil contains hydrogen and, presumably, water. 
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The results from the Mars Odyssey neutron measurements show that there is abundant water beneath the surface at both Martian poles. But they also show a surprising amount of subsurface water in two regions near the equator, Arabia Terra and another region on the opposite side of the planet. One possible explanation is that about a million years ago, gravitational forces from other planets caused a temporary change in the tilt of Mars’s rotation axis. The ice caps were then exposed to more direct sunlight, causing some of the water to evaporate and eventually refreeze elsewhere on the planet. There are other surprising features on Mars related to the presence of water. Several Mars Global Surveyor images show gullies carved by water flowing down the walls of pits or craters. These could have formed when water trapped underground—where the pressure is greater and water can remain a liquid—seeped onto the surface. 
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The gullies appear to be geologically young, so even today some liquid water may survive below the Martian surface. Alternatively, these gullies may have formed during periods when the Martian climate was colder than usual and the slopes of craters were covered with a layer of dust and snow. Melting snow on the underside of this layer could have carved out gullies, which were later exposed when the climate warmed and the snow evaporated. The total amount of water on Mars is not known. But by examining flood channels at various locations around Mars, Michael Carr of the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that there is enough water to cover the planet to a depth of 500 meters (1500 ft). (By comparison, Earth has enough water to cover our planet to a depth of 2700 meters, or 8900 ft.) Thus, while the total amount of water on Mars is less than on Earth, there may be enough to have once formed lakes or seas—one of which may have covered the plains of Sinus Meridianii and produced the sedimentary rocks. Future missions to Mars will delve more deeply into the past climate and geology of the red planet.

          <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.6.	Crust</h4>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	Tectonics on Mars: A Thick, Rigid Crust:</h4>

          <p class="textbookp">
            Mars lacks the global network of ridges and subduction zones that plate tectonics has produced on the Earth. Hence, the entire crust of Mars makes up a single tectonic plate, as is the case on the Moon, Mercury, and Venus. The explanation is quite different from that for Venus, however: Because Mars is a much smaller world than Earth or Venus, the outer layers of the red planet have cooled more extensively. Thus, Mars lacks plate tectonics because its crust is too thick for one part of the crust to be subducted beneath another. We see that for a terrestrial planet to have plate tectonics, the crust must not be too thin (like Venus) or too thick (like Mars), but just right (like Earth). This idea has been verified by carefully monitoring the motion of a spacecraft orbiting Mars. If there is a concentration of mass (such as a thicker crust) at one location on the planet, the gravitational attraction will make the spacecraft speed up as it approaches the concentration and slows down as it moves away. A team of scientists headed by David Smith of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and Maria Zuber of MIT analyzed the orbit of Mars Global Surveyor in just this way. They found that unlike the Earth’s crust, which varies in thickness from 5 to 35 km, the Martian crust is about 40 km thick under the northern lowlands but about 70 km thick under the southern highlands. Both regions of the Martian crust are too thick to undergo subduction, making plate tectonics impossible. Although there is no plate motion on Mars, there are features on the planet’s surface that indicate there has been substantial motion of material in the Martian mantle. The Tharsis rise, visible on the left-hand side, is a dome-shaped bulge that has been lifted 5 to 6 km above the planet’s average elevation. A massive plume of magma once welled upward from a hot spot under this region. East of the Tharsis rise, a vast chasm runs roughly parallel to the Martian equator. If this canyon were located on Earth, it would stretch from Los Angeles to New York. In honor of the Mariner 9 spacecraft that first revealed its presence in 1971, this chasm has been named Valles Marineris. Valles Marineris has heavily fractured terrain at its western end near the Tharsis rise. At its eastern end, by contrast, it is dominated by ancient cratered terrain. Many geologists suspect that Valles Marineris was caused by the same upwelling of material that formed the Tharsis rise. As the Martian surface bulged upward at Tharsis, there would have been tremendous stresses on the crust, which would have caused extensive fracturing. Thus, Valles Marineris may be a rift valley, a feature created when a planet’s crust breaks apart along a fault line. Rift valleys are found on Earth; two examples are the Red Sea and the Rhine River valley in Europe. Other, smaller rifts in the Martian crust are found all around the Tharsis rise. All of these features are very old, however, and it is thought that there has been little geologic activity on Mars for billions of years. Additional evidence that may point to ancient geologic activity on Mars is the crustal dichotomy between the northern lowlands and the southern highlands.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The southern highlands are much more heavily cratered than either Earth or Venus, though less so than the Moon, while the northern lowlands are remarkably smooth and free of craters. Since most cratering occurred early in the history of the solar system, this implies that the northern lowlands are relatively young, while the more heavily cratered southern highlands are relatively old. One proposed explanation is that older craters in the northern lowlands were erased by tectonic activity that took place long ago when the Martian crust had not yet cooled to its present thickness. Other hypotheses are that older craters could have been erased by a giant asteroid impact or by lava flows. A final piece of evidence about ancient Mars is the existence of locally magnetized areas in the old southern highlands. These areas presumably solidified during an era in which the interior of Mars was much hotter, and moving, molten material in the interior developed a magnetic field. Today, by contrast, Mars has no planetwide magnetic field. There is probably still molten material in the core, but the Martian core is thought to contain substantial amounts of sulfur in addition to iron. While temperatures in the core should be high enough to melt sulfur and sulfur compounds, the electrical properties of these substances are such that their motions do not generate the electric currents needed to produce a magnetic field.

          <p class="textbookp">
            Spectroscopic observations from Mars’s orbit confirm that the planet’s rocks and sands are made almost entirely of the three minerals feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine. These are the components of basalt or solidified lava. Thus, Mars, like Venus, had a volcanic past. Unlike lava flows on Venus, however, most of the lava flows on Mars have impact craters on them. The interpretation is that most Martian lava flows are very old and that most of the volcanoes on the red planet are no longer active. This is what we would expect from a small planet whose crust has cooled and solidified to a greater depth than on Earth, making it difficult for magma to travel from the Martian mantle to the surface. However, a few Martian lava flows are crater-free, which suggests that they are only a few million years old. If volcanoes erupted on Mars within the past few million years, are they erupting now? Scientists have used infrared telescopes to search for telltale hot spots on the Martian surface, but have yet to discover any. Perhaps volcanism on Mars is rare but not yet wholly extinct. Spacecraft that have landed on Mars have taught us a great deal about the geology and history of the red planet. Before we explore the Martian surface in detail, however, it is useful to examine the unique atmospheres of both Mars and Venus.

          <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.7.	Canals</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Canals of Mars, apparent systems of long, straight linear markings on the surface of Mars that are now known to be illusions caused by the chance alignment of craters and other natural surface features seen in telescopes near the limit of resolution. They were the subject of much controversy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and influenced popular thinking about the possibility of life beyond Earth.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The Italian astronomer and statesman Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli reported observing about 100 of these markings, beginning in 1877 and described them as Canali (Italian: “channels”), a neutral term that implied nothing about their origin. Other observers had earlier noted similar markings, but Schiaparelli’s writings first drew wide attention to the subject. About the turn of the 20th century, the American astronomer Percival Lowell became the champion of those who believed the markings to be bands of vegetation, kilometers wide, bordering irrigation ditches, or canals, dug by intelligent beings to carry water from the polar caps. Lowell and others described canal networks studded with dark intersections called oases and covering much of the surface of the planet. Occasionally the lines were perceived as doubled; i.e., two parallel lines became visible where only a single canal had been seen before.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Most astronomers could see no canals, and many doubted their reality. Experiments with untrained observers showed that disconnected features in diagrams or drawings might be perceived as straight-line networks when viewed at the proper distance. Telescopic photography through Earth’s atmosphere offered no solution because the lines were barely discernible by the human eye and beyond the recording capability of the camera. The controversy was finally resolved only when close-up images of the Martian surface were taken from spacecraft, beginning with Mariner 4 (1965) and Mariners 6 and 7 (1969). These showed many craters and other features but nothing resembling networks of long linear channels, either natural or artificial.

          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	The mystery of Mars’ interior:</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Unlike our planet, whose internal structure has been well defined, our knowledge of the interior of other planets in the solar system is as yet very limited. Geophysicists gaze at them longingly, dreaming of shedding light on their internal structure just as they have the Earth’s. Because of its similarities and differences with our planet, Mars is a high-priority target for them.
            Up to now, the only measurements relating to Mars’ internal structure have provided information on its mass and diameter (needed to calculate density) and a parameter that geophysicists call the moment of inertia. This was determined from research on the planet’s rotation using probes placed on its surface (see InSight’s RISE experiment). This type of measurement gives geophysicists an idea of the way mass is distributed inside a planet.
            
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Orbiting probes, sensitive to the slightly bumpy nature of globes and the unequal distribution of mass (which modifies the intensity of the gravity field), have only managed to confirm that Mars has the same basic envelopes as the Earth and to estimate the average thickness of the Martian crust.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The presence of a global magnetic field is generally a good indicator of the existence of a molten metal core subjected to convective motions. However, neither Mars nor Venus has such a field.
            Numerous uncertainties remain about the structure and activity of the Martian mantle (© Ana Plesa/DLR). Finally, fragments of rocks ejected from the surface of a planet into space can sometimes land upon the Earth. If they are picked up and identified, these extraterrestrial stones (known as meteorites) can provide geophysicists with valuable information. The mineralogical analyses carried out on Martian meteorites have allowed extrapolations to be made on the nature of the crust and mantle. Important contributions have been made by geochemical measurements taken by orbiting satellites, in addition to in situ analyses carried out on the surface of the Red Planet by the Curiosity rover among others.            
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            However, despite the efforts undertaken to attempt to understand what is hidden in the depths of the Red Planet, there remain many unknowns. The limits and constraints imposed by the measurements carried out to date do not enable us to design even a very simple model of Mars’ internal structure. The exact size and composition of the internal envelopes remain a mystery because measurements of gravity do not result in a single model of the internal structure. Several solutions—sometimes significantly different—can explain, or at least remain coherent with, the measurements were taken.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The acquisition of new information through the application of techniques such as seismology, suited to sounding the inner depths of planets, is thus crucial to extend our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of planets.
            Yet, as paradoxical as it may appear, of all the missions that have landed on Mars up to now, only one—Viking 2—enabled an operational seismometer to be placed on the surface. Unfortunately, throughout its operational life, the instrument only recorded a single event that could have been caused by a mars quake. However, even today—40 years later—this hypothesis is a subject of controversy among the scientific community, and the mystery of the true nature of the vibrations recorded remains to this day.

          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	We talked about crust now we will talk about mental:</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Sandwiched between the crust and the core, the Martian mantle must have a similar composition to that of Earth, going by the composition of Martian meteorites that have crashed down onto our planet. It could also be made up of olivine-rich rocks known as peridotites.
            However, numerous questions remain as to its composition and structure. It could theoretically contain a discontinuity similar to that between the Earth’s upper and lower mantle, with a change in the olivine’s phase. However, because Mars is smaller than the Earth and its field of gravity is weaker, the Martian mantle is perhaps not deep enough for such a discontinuity to exist (it is crucial on Earth).
             </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Theoretical simulations show that the Martian mantle should still be subject to convective motions, the planet having a sufficient amount of heat to fuel such motions. However, unlike the Earth, this convection has perhaps not been able to correctly homogenize the mantle’s material, so the Martian mantle may contain several independent deposits or reservoirs that were never in contact with each other. Geophysicists are also placing their hopes in InSight to resolve this question.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The mantle is a compartment that plays a major role in the development of a planet. By partly melting, the rocky material in the mantle forms magmatic fluids that infiltrate upwards until reaching the crust. There, they can trigger huge volcanic phenomena able to change the climate or foster life-forms able to survive. Furthermore, as we shall see, by playing the role of a heat exchanger between the core and the exterior, the mantle also has a huge influence on the planet’s magnetic field.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            One of the Insight mission’s important objectives is thus to accurately determine the Martian mantle’s thickness, its composition, and the presence or absence of strata.

          <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.9.	Mars magnetic field</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Mars does not presently have a global magnetic field but had one early in its life, similar to that of Earth. However, Mars does have very strong crustal magnetic fields, more than 30 times stronger than those of Earth. Developed a detailed map of the magnetic fields of crustal sources. The absence of magnetization in large impact basins allowed for the first time to establish the time of cessation of the Martian dynamo, more than 3.5 billion years ago. The absence of a global magnetic field for billions of years has contributed to the erosion of the Mars atmosphere by the solar wind and the loss of water. Established a correlation of the horizontal component of the magnetic field with upstream solar wind dynamic pressure.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">2.10.	Mars rotational</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The first reliable record of surface features on Mars was made by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, who observed the planet during the opposition of 1659. He identified a prominent dark feature that we now call Syrtis Major. After observing this feature for several weeks, Huygens concluded that the rotation period of Mars is approximately 24 hours, the same as the Earth. In 1666, the Italian astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini made more-refined observations which showed that a Martian day is 37.5 minutes longer than on Earth. More than a century later, the German-born English astronomer William Herschel found that Mars’s axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane of the planet’s orbit, but is tilted by about 25° away from the perpendicular. This is very close to the Earth’s 231⁄ 2° tilt. This striking coincidence means that Mars experiences Earthlike seasons, with opposite seasons in the northern and southern Martian hemispheres Because Mars takes nearly 2 (Earth) years to orbit the Sun, the Martian seasons last nearly twice as long as on Earth.

          <p class="textbookp">
            like Phobos, Deimos is a small and lumpy, heavily cratered object. Its craters are generally smaller than 1.6 miles (2.5 kilometers) in diameter, however, and it lacks the grooves and ridges seen on Phobos. Typically, when a meteorite hits a surface, the surface material is thrown up and out of the resulting crater. The material usually falls back to the surface surrounding the crater. However, these ejecta deposits are not seen on Deimos, perhaps because the moon's gravity is so low that the ejecta escaped to space. The material does appear to have moved down slopes. Deimos also has a thick regolith, perhaps as deep as 328 feet (100 meters), formed as meteorites pulverized the surface.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Deimos is a dark body that appears to be composed of C-type surface materials, similar to that of asteroids found in the outer asteroid belt.

          <p class="textbookp">
            Phobos, gouged and nearly shattered by a giant impact crater and beaten by thousands of meteorite impacts, is on a collision course with Mars.
Phobos is the larger of Mars' two moons and is 17 x 14 x 11 miles (27 by 22 by 18 kilometers) in diameter. It orbits Mars three times a day and is so close to the planet's surface that in some locations on Mars it cannot always be seen.
Phobos is nearing Mars at a rate of six feet (1.8 meters) every hundred years; at that rate, it will either crash into Mars in 50 million years or break up into a ring. Its most prominent feature is the 6-mile (9.7 kilometers) crater Stickney, its impact causing streak patterns across the moon's surface. Stickney was seen by Mars Global Surveyor to be filled with fine dust, with evidence of boulders sliding down its sloped surface.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Phobos and Deimos appear to be composed of C-type rock, similar to blackish carbonaceous chondrite asteroids. Observations by Mars Global Surveyor indicate that the surface of this small body has been pounded into powder by eons of meteoroid impacts, some of which started landslides that left dark trails marking the steep slopes of giant craters.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Measurements of the day and night sides of Phobos show such extreme temperature variations that the sunlit side of the moon rivals a pleasant winter day in Chicago, while only a few kilometers away, on the dark side of the moon, the climate is harsher than a night in Antarctica. High temperatures for Phobos were measured at 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius) and lows at -170 degrees Fahrenheit (-112 degrees Celsius). This intense heat loss is likely a result of the fine dust on Phobos' surface, which is unable to retain heat.
            Phobos has no atmosphere. It may be a captured asteroid, but some scientists show evidence that contradicts this theory.
