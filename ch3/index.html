          <h4 class="pointinchapter">3.1.	History of communication system </h4>
         

          <p class="textbookp" >
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by Arthur C. Clarke, along with Vahid K. Sanadi building on work by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. In October 1945, Clarke published an article titled "Extraterrestrial Relays" in the British magazine Wireless World. The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary orbits to relay radio signals. Thus, Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the communications satellite and the term 'Clarke Belt' employed as a description of the orbit. 
          </p>
        

          <p class="textbookp">
            Decades later a project named Communication Moon Relay was a telecommunication project carried out by the United States Navy. Its objective was to develop a secure and reliable method of wireless communication by using the Moon as a passive reflector and a natural communications satellite.          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The first artificial Earth satellite was Sputnik 1. Put into orbit by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, it was equipped with an on-board radio-transmitter that worked on two frequencies: 20.005 and 40.002 MHz. Sputnik 1 was launched as a major step in the exploration of space and rocket development. However, it was not placed in orbit to send data from one point on earth to another.
          </p>
         
          <p class="textbookp">
            The first satellite to relay communications was Pioneer 1, an intended lunar probe that was launched on October 11, 1958. Though the spacecraft only made it about halfway to the moon, it flew high enough to carry out the proof of concept relay of telemetry across the world, first from Cape Canaveral to Manchester, England; then from Hawaii to Cape Canaveral; and finally, across the world from Hawaii to Manchester. 
          </p>
                 
           <p class="textbookp">
            The first satellite purpose-built to relay communications was NASA's Project SCORE in 1958, which used a tape recorder to store and forward voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.[7] Courier 1B, built by Philco, launched in 1960, was the world's first active repeater satellite.</p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The first artificial satellite used solely to further advances in global communications was a balloon named Echo 1.[8] Echo 1 was the world's first artificial communications satellite capable of relaying signals to other points on Earth. It soared 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) above the planet after its Aug. 12, 1960 launch. Launched by NASA, Echo 1 was a 30-meter (100 ft) aluminized PET film balloon that served as a passive reflector for radio communications. The world's first inflatable satellite — or "satelloon", as they were informally known — helped lay the foundation of today's satellite communications. The idea behind a communications satellite is simple: Send data up into space and beam it back down to another spot on the globe. Echo 1 accomplished this by essentially serving as an enormous mirror, 10 stories tall, that could be used to reflect communications signals.
           </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            There are two major classes of communications satellites, passive and active. Passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source, toward the direction of the receiver. With passive satellites, the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy reaches the receiver. Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to free-space path loss, so the signal received on Earth is very, very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground. Passive satellites were the first communications satellites, but are little used now. Telstar was the second active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to AT&T as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, Bell Telephone Laboratories, NASA, the British General Post Office, and the French National PTT (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on July 10, 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch. Relay 1 was launched on December 13, 1962, and it became the first satellite to transmit across the Pacific Ocean on November 22, 1963. 
           </p>
           
          <p class="textbookp">
            An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was the Hughes Aircraft Company's Syncom 2, launched on July 26, 1963. Syncom 2 was the first communications satellite in a geosynchronous orbit. It revolved around the earth once per day at a constant speed, but because it still had north-south motion, special equipment was needed to track it. Its successor, Syncom 3 was the first geostationary communications satellite. Syncom 3 obtained a geosynchronous orbit, without a north-south motion, making it appear from the ground as a stationary object in the sky.

          <p class="textbookp">
            Beginning with the Viking program, all Mars landers, aside from Mars Pathfinder, have used orbiting spacecraft as communications satellites for relaying their data to Earth. The landers use UHF transmitters to send their data to the orbiters, which then relay the data to Earth using either X band or Ka-band frequencies. These higher frequencies, along with more powerful transmitters and larger antennas, permit the orbiters to send the data much faster than the landers could manage to transmit directly to Earth, which conserves valuable time on the receiving antennas.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">3.2.	 The Near-Earth Network (NEN)</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Formerly known as the Ground Network, the Near-Earth Network (NEN) provides telemetry, commanding, ground-based tracking, data, and communications services to a wide range of customers. The NEN provides these services to customers with satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous orbit (GEO) highly elliptical orbit, Lunar orbit, and missions with multiple frequency bands. Customers are both national and international, government and commercial entities, NASA (Earth Science, Space Science, and Human Explorations missions) and non-NASA. The Near-Earth Network utilizes both NASA-owned and commercial stations around the world to ensure proper service to customers.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">3.3.	Space network (SN)</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The Space Network (SN) was established in the early 1980s to replace NASA's worldwide network of ground tracking stations. It is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days per year. Operations on the network run above 99.5% proficiency every month.
            The Space Network consists of a constellation of geosynchronous (Earth orbiting) satellites named the Tracking Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) Ground systems that operate as a relay system between satellites. Satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) above 73 km. Ground facilities.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">3.4.	Deep space network (DSN)</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            An international network of antennas that provide the communication links between the scientists and engineers on Earth to the missions in space and on Mars.
            The DSN consists of three deep-space communications facilities placed approximately 120 degrees apart around the world: at Goldstone, in California's Mojave Desert; near Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia. This strategic placement permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates on its axis.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	Size and shape:</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The DSN antennas are extremely large: 34 meters (about 37 yards) and 70 meters (about 76 yards). These enormous antennas enable humans to reach out to spacecraft millions of miles away. The larger the antenna, the stronger the signal and the greater the amount of information the antenna can send and receive. The Mars Science Laboratory, while in its cruise stage configuration, communicated through low and medium-gain antennas. While Curiosity is roving on the planet, it is communicating with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter via its UHF antenna and to the DSN on Earth by way of its high-gain antenna.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•  Signals:</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The Deep Space Network (DSN) communicates with nearly all spacecraft flying throughout our solar system. Many spacecrafts are cruising in space, observing Saturn, the sun, asteroids, and comets. Besides, the Mars Exploration Rovers are still busy on the surface of Mars and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has joined the other Martian orbiters. The DSN antennas are extremely busy trying to track all of these space missions at once. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft must therefore share time on the DSN antennas. A sophisticated scheduling system with a team of hundreds of negotiators around the world ensures that each mission's priorities are met.
            During critical mission events, such as landing on Mars, multiple antennas on Earth, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter track the signals from the spacecraft to minimize the risk of loss of communication. During the landed operations phase on the Martian surface, the Mars Science Laboratory utilizes the Multiple Spacecraft Per Aperture (MSPA) capability of the DSN, which allows a single DSN antenna to receive downlink from up to four spacecraft simultaneously, as well as using the relay capabilities of the Mars Odyssey (ODY) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The rover's downlink sessions (when the rover sends information back to Earth) are generally roughly 15 minutes each, with usually two downlink sessions per relay orbiter (ODY, MRO) per Martian day (sol), with two sessions overnight and two sessions in the late Martian afternoon. MSPA allows only one spacecraft at a time to have the uplink, and Curiosity commands early in each sol (Martian day) for roughly 30 minutes to provide the instructions for that sol's activities.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter"style="font-size: 20px;padding: 15px 0px 10px 25px;">•	Special signal tones the DSN received during entry, descent, and landing:</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            During the entry, descent, and landing phase of the Mars Exploration Rover mission, engineers listened anxiously for 128 distinct tones that indicated when steps in the process were activated; one sound indicated the parachute deployed, while another signaled that the airbags had inflated. These sounds were a series of basic, special individual radio tones.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft transmitted in X-band during its entry, descent, and landing process, which was the expected path for confirmation of the initial events in the process. Due to signal strength constraints, these transmissions were simple tones, comparable to semaphore codes, rather than full telemetry. The Deep Space Network listened for these direct-to-Earth transmissions. However, Earth went out of view of the spacecraft, “setting” below the Martian horizon, partway through the descent, so the X-band tones were not available for confirming the final steps in descent and landing. By then, the bent-pipe relay via Odyssey had begun.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">3.5.	  Communication through Mars-orbiting spacecraft</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Not only does the rover send messages directly to the DSN stations, but it is also able to uplink information to other spacecraft orbiting Mars, utilizing mainly the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey (if necessary) spacecraft as messengers that pass along the news to Earth for the rover. The respective spacecraft mainly "talk" via their UHF antennas. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter carries an Electra UHF payload with the capability of helping navigate the Mars Science Laboratory safely toward Mars. The Ka-Band package aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can serve as another possible pipeline to "talk" to the Mars Science Laboratory (read more about the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Engineering Instruments).
            The benefits of using the orbiting spacecraft are that the orbiters are closer to the rover than the DSN antennas on Earth and the orbiters have Earth in their field of view for much longer periods than the rover on the ground.
          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            Because the orbiters are only between 160 and 250 miles (257 and 400 kilometers) above the surface of Mars, the rover doesn’t have to "yell" as loudly (or use as much energy to send a message) to the orbiters as it does to the antennas on Earth.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pointinchapter">3.6.	 X-band radio waves</h4>
          <p class="textbookp">
            the rover communicates with the orbiters and the DSN through radio waves. They communicate with each other through X-band, which are radio waves at a much higher frequency than radio waves used for FM stations.
            The radio waves to and from the rover are sent through the orbiters using UHF antennas, which are close-range antennas that are like walkie-talkies compared to the long-range of low-gain and high-gain antennas. All three orbiters active at Mars — NASA’s Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the European Space Agency’s Mars Express — were at positions where they could receive transmissions from the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft during its entry, descent, and landing. Only Odyssey relayed the information immediately, however. The other two orbiters recorded Mars Science Laboratory data from the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, holding it onboard, and sending it to Earth hours later. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter even captured images of the spacecraft on its parachute during entry, descent, and landing.
            </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            The cruise stage had two antennas that were used to communicate with the Earth. The low-gain antenna was Omni-directional and was used when the spacecraft was near the Earth. Because it radiated in all directions, the low-gain antenna did not need to be pointed at the Earth to enable a communications link. The medium-gain antenna was a directional antenna that had to be pointed toward the Earth for communications but had more power to communicate when the spacecraft was farther away from the Earth. The medium-gain antenna acted like a floodlight and could direct the energy into a tighter beam to reach Earth. Just like a floodlight directs more light into a focused area than a normal light bulb does out of a lamp, the medium-gain antenna could direct the data from the spacecraft into a tighter beam than the low-gain antenna.          </p>
          <p class="textbookp">
            When the rover speaks directly to Earth (from the surface of Mars), it sends messages via its high-gain antenna (HGA). The high-gain antenna can send a "beam" of information in a specific direction and it is steerable, so the antenna can move to point itself directly to an antenna on Earth. The benefit of having a steerable antenna is that the entire rover doesn't necessarily have to change positions to talk to Earth. Like turning your neck to talk to someone beside you rather than turning your entire body, the rover can save energy by moving only the antenna.
